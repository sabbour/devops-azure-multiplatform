# DEVOPS Function App - Function App and Azure Cosmos DB demo

This demo contains simple one page web app with REST API backend and Azure Cosmos DB for data persistence.

Demonstrated DEVOPS scenario:
* automatically create infrastructure environment (Function App and Azure Cosmos DB).
* configure Function App with Azure Cosmos DB credentials and GitHub repository with application source codes.
* When developer changes application code and pushed changes to `funcapp` branch Function App collect changes from GitHub and deploy new version of application.

Function App:
* exposes REST APIs for listing ToDoes, creating and editing ToDo records.
* Function "StaticFileServer" together with proxy rules in Fuction App is able to serve static pages (located in folder www) - thanks Anthony Chu for great article about file serving from Function App: http://anthonychu.ca/post/azure-functions-static-file-server/ 


Solution can be provisioned by this template, important attributes are:
* App name - unique name for your Function App
* Repo URL - github url for your repository with application
* Branch - github branch which will be used
* Azure Cosmos Db name - unique name for your Cosmos DB
* Storage account type

After successful deployment you can reach your application from web browser on URL: `https://[YOUR-FUNCTIONAPP-NAME].azurewebsites.net`

Notes:
If you want to change code or in another way to play with application use these steps:
* fork original repository (to be able to commit changes there) - original repo: https://github.com/valda-z/devops-azure-multiplatform/tree/funcapp
* when deploying application by template use your Repo URL in field "Repo URL"
* when you are done with changes you can git add; git commit; git push your changes to github, Function App will collect new version of files automatically in few seconds and you can see new version of your app deployed.
